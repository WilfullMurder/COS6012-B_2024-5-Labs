# COS6012-B_2024-5_SEM2_BDA: Concurrent and Distributed Systems
Welcome to my repository for the <strong>COS6012-B: Concurrent and Distributed Systems</strong> Software Engineering BEng module at the <strong>University of Bradford.</strong> <br>
This repository contains the solutions and code examples for each of the lab sessions, which cover various topics in <strong> concurrent programming </strong> and <strong> distributed systems </strong>. <br>
The labs focus heavily on the book `Java 9 Concurrency Cookbook` by `Javier FernÃ¡ndez GonzÃ¡lez`. This book was published by `packt` in 2017 and may cover some outdated Java concepts.

This repo is meant for CompSci/Software students at the <strong>University of Bradford</strong> as a complement to the <strong>Concurrent and Distributed Systems </strong> module.
